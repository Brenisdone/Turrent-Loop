Turret Loop is an arcade shooter that uses path-building mechanics, similar to train track and city-building games, to let the player traverse and gain more space to dodge incoming bullets.

**Gameplay:**
The player initially starts at one loop and can move around and shoot enemies.  
With enough points (200), the player can build more loops around the circle.  
The player can then switch from one loop to another.

**Controls:**  
D = move clockwise  
A = move counter-clockwise  
Arrow keys = adjust position of path overlays  
Shift (hold) = switch to the closest loop  
Space = shoot  
Tab = enter building mode  
Alt+F4 = exit

**Developer note:**  
Hey there. If you tried my game, thank you — any feedback is appreciated.  
This is my first finished game, so I understand the loop-switching needs work and the enemy spawn ramp-up could be smoother.  
If you have experience with Godot and think you could improve it, please let me know. I’d love to keep working on this game.
